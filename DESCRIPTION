Description: Constructing a plot in the ggplot package is currently based around
  "adding" elements together. When components are added, the plot object is modified,
  although "adding" is not always the appropriate verb to describe the action that
  took place when the component was added. This package adds verb functions that
  allow for coherent use of ggplot with the pipe, without masking any
  ggplot functions.
